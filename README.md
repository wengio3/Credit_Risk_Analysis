# Credit_Risk_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis

_Fast Lending is a peer lending services company. This analysis is created using machine learning to predict credit risk. Machine learning is more accurate in identifying qualified candidates for loans, which will lead to lower default rates. Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans.  Credit risk is an inherently unstable classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, this analysis oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. To be able to predict credit risk._
